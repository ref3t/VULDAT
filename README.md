# VULDAT
VULDAT is a novel approach proposed in the current repository. VULDAT stands for Automated Vulnerability Detection From Cyberattack Text. It is a method that uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to recommend software vulnerabilities from textual descriptions of cyberattacks. VULDAT can help cybersecurity experts to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities based on real threats and to develop more effective mitigation strategies. VULDAT uses information from the MITRE repositories, such as ATT&CK, CAPEC, CWE, and CVE, to create a dataset of attacks and vulnerabilities. VULDAT also uses a sentence transformer model to compute semantic similarity between attack texts and vulnerability descriptions and to produce a ranked list of relevant CVEs. VULDAT can also recommend new links between attacks and vulnerabilities that are not yet established in the repositories.
